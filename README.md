## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-management-system.git
```

### Step 2: Set Up the Database
1. **Install XAMPP**:
   - Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
   - Start **Apache** and **MySQL** from the XAMPP Control Panel.

2. **Create the Database**:
   - Open **phpMyAdmin** by navigating to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
   - Create a new database named `hotelmanagementdb`.

3. **Create Tables**:
   - Run the following SQL script to create the required tables:
     ```sql
     USE hotelmanagementdb;

     CREATE TABLE Rooms (
         RoomID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
         RoomNumber INT NOT NULL,
         IsBooked BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE
     );

     CREATE TABLE Guests (
         GuestID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
         Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
     );

     CREATE TABLE Bookings (
         BookingID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
         RoomID INT,
         GuestID INT,
         BookingDate DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
         FOREIGN KEY (RoomID) REFERENCES Rooms(RoomID),
         FOREIGN KEY (GuestID) REFERENCES Guests(GuestID)
     );
     ```

### Step 3: Configure the Connection String
1. Open the `App.config` file in the project.
2. Update the connection string to match your MySQL credentials:
   ```xml
   <connectionStrings>
       <add name="HotelManagementDB" 
            connectionString="Server=localhost;Database=hotelmanagementdb;Uid=root;Pwd=;" 
            providerName="MySql.Data.MySqlClient" />
   </connectionStrings>
   ```
   - Replace `root` and the empty password (`Pwd=`) with your MySQL credentials if youâ€™ve set a password.

### Step 4: Build and Run the Application
1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.
2. Build the solution by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + B`.
3. Run the application by pressing `F5`.
